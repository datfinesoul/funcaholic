# IMPORTANT WORKFLOW
- When referencing an online document in an solution, ALWAYS add the bookmark via mcp__bookmark-manager__add, with title being a meaningful description url the article URL and category "ai-research"
- script files should be named with an extension based on the shell.  (eg. BASH = .bash, ZSH = .zsh)
- ONLY add comments in sections that are complicated, not to re-iterate what code does.
